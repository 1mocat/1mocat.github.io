    <h> Here is the instruction of how to make a cake: 
        Making a delicious cake involves several steps and can be a joyful experience when done properly. 
        There are various types of cakes, but I will provide you with a general process for creating a simple vanilla cake.
        1. Gather ingredients: To create a simple vanilla cake, you will need all-purpose flour, sugar, butter, eggs, milk, baking powder, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt.
        2. Prepare the batter: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla extract.
        3. Mix dry ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Gradually add these dry ingredients to the butter mixture, alternating with milk, beginning and ending with the flour mixture.
        4. Pour into pan: Grease and flour your cake pan. Pour the batter into the prepared pan, spreading it evenly.
        5. Bake the cake: Place the pan in the preheated oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
        6. Cool and serve: Remove from oven and let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack. Once completely cooled, you can frost and decorate as desired.
